Getting Started

### Requirements

+ Terminal and shell (bash or [zsh](http://www.zsh.org))
+ [Git](http://git-scm.com) v2.x
+ Modern code editor ([Vim](http://vim.org), [Atom](https://atom.io), [Sublime](https://sublimetext.com))
+ Modern web browser (Google Chrome or Firefox)
+ HTTP client app like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) or [Postman](https://getpostman.com)
+ [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Meteor](http://meteor.com): JavaScript platform and a full stack framework, currently Node `v0.10.x` and Meteor `v1.3`.
+ [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react) knowledge, a UI library.
+ No CSS framework here. Choose your own in the frontend you build.

### Installation

+ Install Node.js from your prefered way, or from <http://nodejs.org>
  + It's also recommended to [use Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
+ Install required npm packages/modules with `npm install` within this repo
+ Install pm2 globally (`npm install -g pm2`)
+ Install mupX globally (`npm install -g mupx`)

### Development

+ Fork the repository
+ Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`)
+ Make your changes with your editor (`vim` or `atom` or `sublime`)
+ Commit your changes (`git commit -a`)
+ Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`)
+ Create new Pull Request

### Usage and Deployment

Use `meteor --settings settings.json` to run the app. Access `http://{host}:{port}/{api_route}` or that already shown in the prompt to view.

Use mupx (`npm install -g mupx`) to deploy based on `mup.json`. For smooth deployment, notice that you should have a proper access to the server. It's recommended to use SSH key that is already added/registered there. You might want to use `ssh-copy-id username@xx.xx.xx.xx` first.
